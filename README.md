## Air RB Parser READ ME

A brief overview of the problem before describing the application.

- In the MMO game "War Thunder", in the "Air Realistic Battle" mode you are matched with other players based on the rating of your plane. The ratings start at 1.0 and go all the way up to 13.0. The matchmaker can place you against planes around your own plane's rating, up to +-1.0 of your plane's rating.

- This means that you can be potentially facing higher or lower tier planes, making it possible to have a tougher or easier match.

- The only way to tell if you are in an "uptier" or a "downtier" scenario is to deduce it from your own team's lineup, as you are unable to see what the opposite team is fielding.

- As there are over 1160+ vehicles and vehicle variants in the game, it is rather difficult to know them all.

- The purpose of this application is to read a screenshot of your team's lineup, and directly tell the user what kind of game they are in by revealing the rating of each vehicle and thus showing whether it is a "downtier" or an "uptier".
